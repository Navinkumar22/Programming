/*
Files Exercise 1
Problem
Write a program that reads a text file and returns the number of lines as well as the total number of characters in the file.
Expected Output
You may add additional helper functions if youâ€™d like, but your program must include the following line of code:
string path = argv[1];
The variable path allows for different text files to be sent to your program for testing. The TRY IT button below will send a test file to your program. You should see the following output:
4 line(s)
228 character(s)
